# (PART) Step 1: Design {-}

# UX Matters {#matters}

We have a natural tendency, as R-coders, to be focused on the back-end, i.e the server part of the application^[aka what happens in the server side of a Shiny App]. 
Which is perfectly normal—chances are you didn't come to R to design front-ends
^[Front-end are the visual parts of your application, the one your user interacts with, as opposed to the back-end, which is what is installed on the server, the part the end user doesn't see. 
In Shiny, front-end is what correspond to the UI, back-end to the server.]. 
But let's state the truth: no matter how complex and innovative your backend is, your application is bad if your User Experience (UX) is bad. 
That's the hard truth. 
If people can't understand how to use your application, your application isn't successful, no matter how incredible the backend is. 
This natural taste for back-end / server logic can deserve you on the long run: by neglecting the UI and the UX, you'll make your application less likely to be adopted among your users. 
Which is a good way to fail your application project.

## Simplicity is Gold

> "Simplify, then add lightness"

> __Colin Chapman CBE, Founder of Lotus Cars__

There are mainly two contexts where you'll be building a web app with R: one for professional use (i.e people will rely on this app to do their job), or for fun (i.e people will just use the app as a distraction). 
But in both cases, people will want the app to be usable, and __easily__ usable. 

If people use your app in a professional context, they don't want to fight with your interface, read complex manuals, or lose time understanding what they are supposed to do and how they are supposed to use your application. 
In other words, they want an efficient tool: something that, beyond being accurate, is easy to grasp.
In a professional context, when it comes to "Business applications", remember that the easier the learning curve the better the user experience.
Think about all the professional applications and softwares that you've been ranting about during your professional life, all these cranky user interfaces you haven't understand and/or you need to relearn every time you use them. 
You don't want your app to be one of these applications. 

And on the other end, if users open your app for fun, they are not going to fight your app into submission: they are just going to give up if it's too complex to be used.
Even a game has to appear easy to use when the users open it.

Aiming for simplicity is a hard thing, but following some rules will help you start on a solid ground.
In this section, we'll review two general principals: the "don't make me think" principle, which states that interfaces should be as self-explanatory as possible, and the "Rule of least surprise", stating that elements should behave the way they are commonly expected to behave.
These two rules aim at solving one issue: the bigger the cognitive load of your app is, the harder it will be for the end-user to use your app on a daily basis.
And of course, the less a success your project will be. 

### How we read the web: scanning content 

One big lie we tell ourselves as developer is that end-user will use the app the way we designed it to be used. 
We love to think that when faced to our app, the users will carefully read the instructions, make a rational decision based on careful examination of the inputs, before doing what we expect them to do. 
But the harsh truth is that it's not how what happens. 

First of all, user rarely read carefully all the instructions: they __scan__, and perform the first action that more or less match what they need to do, i.e the __satisfice__. 

![](img/scanning.png)

> FROM 'Don't make me think', Steve Krug

For example, let's have a look at the user interface of `hexmake`, a Shiny app for building hex stickers, available at https://connect.thinkr.fr/hexmake/

![](img/hexmake.png)


What will be your reading pattern for this application? 
What is the first thing you'll do when using this app?

There is an inherent logic in the application: each submenu is designed to handle one specific part of your sticker. 
The last-but-one menu is the one used to download the sticker, and the last one the menu to open the "how to" of the app. 
When opening this app, will your fist move be to open the how to? 
Will you open all the sub-menu and select the most "logical" one to start with? 
Chances are that reading this line, you think you'll do that. 
But in reality, we behave less rationally that we'd like to think. 
What we most of the time do is click on the first thing that matches what we are here to do. 
For example, most of the time we will first change the package name, or upload an image, before even opening the about section of this app. 

Once user have scanned the page, they perform the first action that seems reasonable. 
Or as coined in "Rational Choice and the Structure of the Environment" by Herbert A. Simon, __" organisms adapt well enough to “satisfice”; they do not, in general, “optimize.”"__. 
In other words, __"As soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we’re looking for, there’s a very good chance that we’ll click it"__ ('Don't make me think', Steve Krug).

What that also means is that user might perform what you'd expect to be "irrational" choices. 
As they are scanning your webpage, they might do something unexpected, or use a part of your app in a way that you wouldn't expect it to be used. 
For example, if you are creating an app that is designed to take as input data that comes under a specific form, you __need__ to check that this requirement is fulfill, or you'll end up debugging errors on uncommon datasets. 
This is a pretty common thing about apps and about software in general: you have to expect users to use your product in ways you wouldn't have expect, in way that might seem absurd to you. 

For example, consider this small app: 

```{r ux-matters-1, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
ui <- function(request){
  tagList(
    selectInput(
      "species", 
      "Choose one or more species",
      choices = unique(iris$Species),
      multiple = TRUE, 
      selected = unique(iris$Species)[1]
    ), 
    plotOutput("plt")
  )
}

server <- function(
  input, 
  output, 
  session
){
  output$plt <- renderPlot({
    plot(
      iris[ iris$Species %in% input$species, ]
    )
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

What's wrong with this app? Probably nothing from a developer point of view: there's a label expliciting that one should select one or more element from the dropdown, and then something is plotted. 
Pretty standard. 
But what happen if the dropdown is empty? 
Our first conception would be that this would never happen, as it's explicitly specified that there should be one or more elements selected. 
In fact, chances are that even with this label, users will eventually end up with an empty `selectInput`, leading to the printing of an error where the plot should be.  

What should we do? 
Adopt a defensive programming mindset. 
Every time you create interactive elements, inputs and outputs, or things the user might interact with, ask yourself: "what if [that crazy thing] happens? How do I handle the case where the minimal viable requirements for my app are not met?".
And in fact, you shouldn't be focusing on that only for the user side: the backed should also be examined for potential unexpected behavior. 
For example, if your Shiny app relies on a database connection, you should check gracefully that the connection is possible, and if it's not, send a message to your user that the database is not reachable, and that they should either restart the app or come back in a few minutes. 

In fact, this is a crucial thing when it comes to making your app successful: you should always fail gracefully and informatively. 
That means that when your R code fails, the whole app shouldn't fail. 
If the R code fails for some reason, the user should get back either nothing or an informative bug message, not be faced with a grey page over the application. 
Because of the way Shiny is designed, a lot of R errors will make the Shiny app fail completely. 
If you haven't think about this upfront, that means that a user might use the app for say 10 minutes, do a series of specifications, enter parameters and data, and at some point the app completely crashes. 
Then the user has to restart from scratches, because there is no native way, from there, to restart from where the app has crashed.
This is a very important thing to keep in mind when building Shiny app: once the app has failed, there is no easy way to get it back to the moment just before it crashed, meaning that your users might lose a significant amount of time they have spent configuring the app. 

### A self-evident app (or at least self-explanatory)

One of the goal of a usable app is to make it self-evident, and fall back to a self explanatory app if the first option is too complex a goal. 
What's the difference between the two? 

> self-evident : "Not needing to be demonstrated or explained; obvious." [lexico.com](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/self_evident)

> self-explanatory : "Easily understood; not needing explanation." [https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/self_explanatory](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/self_explanatory)

So the first is that the app is designed in such a way that there is no learning curve to using it.
A self-explanatory app has a small learning curve, but it's designed in a way that will make the user understand it in a matter of seconds. 

Let's for example get back to our `{tidytuesday201942}` application available at [connect.thinkr.fr/tidytuesday201942](https://connect.thinkr.fr/tidytuesday201942/)
By itself, this application is not self-evident: you need to have a series of background knowledge before understanding what this application was designed for. 
For example, you might need to have a vague sense of what `tidytuesday` is. 
If you don't, you'll have to read the home text, which will help you understand what this is. 
Then, if we have a look at the menu, we see that these are a series of functions from `{ggplot2}`: without any background about the package, you might find it difficult understanding what this app actually does.

Yet, if you want to understand what this app is designed for, you'll find enough information either on the home page or in the About section, with external links if needed. 
And of course, when building apps, context matters. 
The `{tidytuesday201942}` app is one that has been developed in the context of `tidytuesday`, an online weekly event for learning data analysis, mainly through the use of `{tidyverse}` packages. 
So there is a good chance visitors of the app will already know what is `{ggplot2}` when visiting the app. 

#### The "Rule of Least Surprise"

Also know as "Principle of Least Astonishment."

> Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.

`r right_link("'Basic of the Unix Philosophy', Eric Steven Raymond", "http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2878339")`

When we are browsing the web, we have a series of pre-conception about what things are and what they do. 
For example, we expect an underline text to be clickable: so there's a good chance that if you use underline text inside your app, the user will try to click on it. 
Usually, the link is also colored differently from the rest of the text. 
Same goes for the pointer of the mouse, which usually switch from an arrow to a small hand with a finger up. 
A lot of other conventions exist on the web, and you should endeavor to follow them: a clickable link should have at least one of the properties we just described—and if it's neither underlined nor colored nor changing the pointer when it's hovered, chances are that the user won't click on it. 

Just imagine for a second if our "Download" button in the `{tidytuesday201942}` app didn't actually download the graph you had generated. 
Even more, imagine if this button didn't download the graph but something else. 
How would you feel about this experience? 

And it's not just about links: almost every visual elements on a web page is surrounded by conventions. 
Buttons should have borders. 
Links should appear clickable. 
Bigger texts are headers. 
Elements "visually nested" are related. 
Etc. 
Weirdly enough, that's an easy thing to spot when we arrive on a webpage / an app: it can either feel "natural", or you can immediately see that something is off. 
The hard thing is that it's something you spot when you are a new-comer: developing the app makes us so familiar with the app that we might miss when something is not used the way it's conventionally used^[
For a good summary of these, see [The cranky user: The Principle of Least Astonishment](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/us-cranky10/us-cranky10-pdf.pdf)
].

Let's exemplify this with the "Render" button from the [`{tidytuesday201942}`](https://connect.thinkr.fr/tidytuesday201942/) application. 
This app is built on top of Bootstrap 4, which has no CSS class for `{shiny}` action button^[
`{shiny}` is built on top of Bootstrap 3, and the action buttons are of class `btn-default`, which was removed in Bootstrap 4.
]. 
Result: without any further CSS, the buttons don't come out as buttons, making it harder to decipher they are actually buttons. 
Compare this native design:

![](img/tidytuesdaybutton1.png)

To the one with a little bit of CSS (which is the one online):

![](img/tidytuesdaybutton2.png)

Yes, it's subtle, yet the second version of the button is clearer to understand.

Least surprise is crucial to make the user experience a good one: users rarely think that if something is behaving unexpectedly on an app it's because of the app—they'll usually think it's their fault. 

> When users are astonished they usually assume that they have made a mistake; they are unlikely to realize that the page has astonished them. They are more likely to feel that they are at fault for not anticipating the page. Don't take advantage of this; making users feel stupid is not endearing.

`r right_link("The cranky user: The Principle of Least Astonishment", "https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/us-cranky10/us-cranky10-pdf.pdf")`


#### Think about the progression

If there is a progression in your app, you should have designed a clear pattern of moving forward. 
If you need to bring your user from step 1 to step 7, you need to guide them through the whole process, and it can be as simple as putting "Next" buttons on the bottom of each page.  

Inside your app, this progression has to be clear, even more if step n+1 relies on the inputs from n. 
A good and simple way to do that is to hide elements at step n+1 until all the requirements are fulfilled at step n.
Indeed, you can be sure that if step 2 relies on step 1 and you didn't hide step 2 until you have everything you need, users will go to step 2 too soon. 

Another way to help this readability is to ensure some kind of linear logic through the app: step 1, data upload, step 2, data cleaning, step 3, data visualization, step 4, exporting the report. 
And organised your application around this logic, from left to right / right to left, or from top to bottom. 

Let's compare `{tidytuesday201942}` to `{hexmake}` — one has a clear progression, `{hexmake}`, and has been designed as such: the upper menus design the stickers, and then once they are filled you can download them. 
So there's a progression here, from top to bottom. 
On the other hand, the `{tidytuesday201942}` doesn't have a progression inside it: you can navigate from one tab to the other indifferently. 
Hence there is no visual clues of progression on that app.

#### Inputs and errors

You're the one developing the app, so of course you're conscious of all the inputs that are needed to complete a specific task. 
But your user might be new to the app, distracted while reading, they might not clearly understand what they are doing, maybe they don't really want to use your app but are forced to by their boss...
Or maybe your app is a little bit hard to understand, so it's hard to know what to do at first. 

When building your app, you should make sure that if an input is necessary, it's made clear inside the app. 
One way to do this is simply by hiding UI elements that can't be used until all the necessary inputs are there. 
For example, if you're building a dashboard and tab 2 needs specific inputs from tab 1, then tab 3 specific inputs from tab 2, then be sure that tab 2 and 3 are not clickable / available until all the required inputs are filled. 
That way, you can help the user navigate through the app, by reducing the cognitive load of having to be sure that everything is correctly set-up: if it's not clickable, that's because something is missing. 
Think about all the time when you're ordering something on the internet, and need to fill specific fields before being able to click on the "Validate" button. 
Well, apply that approach to your app, that will prevent from unwanted mistakes. 

Note that when using the `golem::use_utils_ui()` function, you'll end with a script of UI tools, one being `with_red_star`, which adds a little red star at the end of the text you're entering:

```{r ux-matters-2, echo = FALSE}
with_red_star <- function(text) {
  htmltools::tags$span(
    HTML(
      paste0(
        text,
        htmltools::tags$span(
          style = "color:red", "*"
        )
      )
    )
  )
}
```

```{r ux-matters-3}
with_red_star("Enter your name here")
```

Also, be generous when it comes to errors: it's rather frustrating for a user to see an app crash without any explanation about what went wrong.
So, if something fails or behaves unexpectedly, error messages are a key feature to help your user get on the right track. 
And, at the same time, helping them correct themselves after an error is the best way to save you time answering angry emails!

Let's refactor our app from before:

```{r ux-matters-4, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
ui <- function(request){
  tagList(
    selectInput(
      "species", 
      "Choose one or more species",
      choices = unique(iris$Species),
      multiple = TRUE, 
      selected = unique(iris$Species)[1]
    ), 
    plotOutput("plt")
  )
}

server <- function(
  input, 
  output, 
  session
){
  output$plt <- renderPlot({
    if (length(input$species) == 0){
      shiny::showNotification(
        type = "error", 
        "Species can't be empty"
      )
    }
    req(input$species)
    plot(
      iris[ iris$Species %in% input$species, ]
    )
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Here, as a user, it's way easier to understand what went wrong: we've moved from a red error `Error: need finite 'xlim' values` to a pop-up explaining what went wrong in the way the user configured the app. 
Perfect way to reduce your bug tracker incoming tickets!

This is a way to do it natively in Shiny, but note that you can also use the  `{shinyAlert}` package to implement alerts. 
It's also possible to build your own with a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## The danger of feature-creep

### What's feature-creep?

Feature-creep is the process of adding features to the app that complexify the using of the product, to the point that extreme feature-creep can lead to the product being entirely unusable. 
This movement always starts well-intentioned: easier navigation, more information, more visualizations, modifiable elements, and so on and so forth. 
It can come from project managers or dev, but users can also be responsible for asking more and more features in the app.
If you're working in a context where the app specifications where designed by the users, or where you regularly meet the users for their feedbacks, they'll most of the time be asking for more than what is efficiently implementable. 
Behind feature-creep, there is always a will to make the user experience better, but adding more and more things most of the time leads to a slower app, worst user experience, steeper learning curve, and all these bad states you don't want your app to be into. 

Let's take a rather common data analytic process: querying data, cleaning them, then plotting and summarizing them.
And let's say that we want to add to this a simple admin dashboard, that tracks what the users do in the app. 
It's pretty tempting to think of this as a single thing an throw the whole code base into one big project and hope for the best. 
But let's decompose what we've got there for a minute: one task is querying and cleaning, one other is analyzing, and one other is administration. 
What's the point of having one big app for these three unlinked tasks? 
Splitting this all project into three smaller apps will keep you from having a large app which is harder to maintain, and that might be less performing.
Indeed, if you put everything into the same app, you'll have to add extra mechanisms to prevent the admin panel from loading if your user simply wants to go to the extraction step, and vice versa: a user visiting the admin panel probably doesn't need the extraction and analysis backend to be loaded when they simply want to browse the way other users have been using the app. 

Or, as simply put in _The Art of Unix Programing_: 

> Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.

But let's focus on a smaller scope, and think about some things that can be thought of as feature-creeping your Shiny app.

### Restrain reactivity 

When designing an app, you'll be thinking about the way users will navigate through the app. 
And most of the time, we design with "correct selection" in mind. 
Something like: __"The user will select 40 on the `sliderInput()` and the plot will update automatically. 
Then the user will select the element they need in the `selectInput()` and the plot will update automatically"__. 
When the reality will be more like: __"The user will click on the slider, aim at 40 but will reach 45, then 37, before having the right amount of 40. 
Then they'll select something in the `selectInput()`, but chances are not the correct one from the first time.__

In real life usage, people make mistakes using the app, so if the application reacts to their every moves, the experience using the app can be bad: in the example above, full reactivity means that you might get 4 "wrong" recomputation of the plot before getting it right. 

In the `{tidytuesday201942}` application example, let's imagine all the elements on the left automatically update the plot: especially in a context of a learning tool, reacting to any configuration change will launch a lot of useless computation, slowing the app on the long run. 

![](img/tidytuesdayapp.png)

So what should we do? 
Prevent ourselves from implementing "full reactivity": instead, we'll add a user input that will launch the computation. 
The simplest solution being a button so that the user signals to the application than now they are ready for the application to compute what they have parametrized.

### Too much interactivity 

Users __love__ interactive elements. 
Maybe too much. 
If you present a user with a choice between a simple graph and a dynamic one, chances are that they'll spontaneously go for the dynamic graph. 
Yet, dynamic is not always the solution, and for several reasons. 

#### Speed

Dynamic elements are slower to render than fixed one. 
Most of the time (if not always), rendering dynamic elements means that you'll bind some external libraries, and maybe you'll have to make R convert data from one format to another.
For example, rendering a `{ggplot2}` plot will be faster than rendering a `ggplotly()` plot, which has to convert from one format to another^[
Well, maybe the native `{plotly}` implementation is faster, but you get the spirit.
].

#### Visual noise

The more the interactivity, the less straightforward the element is. 
Think for a minute about the `{plotly}` outputs. 
They are awesome if you need this kind of interactivity, but for a common plot there might be too many things to understand. 
Instead of focusing on the data, a lot of things show: buttons to zoom, to do selection, to export in png, and things like that. 
With this kind of graphs, users might lose some time focusing on understanding what the buttons do and why they are there, instead of focusing what on what matters: getting insights from the data.

![](img/plotly.png)

Of course these feature are awesome if you need them: exploring data interactively is a fundamental strength when the context is right. 
But if there is no solid reason for using an interactive table, use a standard HTML table. 
In other words, don't make things interactive if there is no value in adding interactivity ; for example, if the users don't need to sort the table, filter, navigate in pages, `DT::datatable()` will add more visual noise than adding value to the application.

Adding interactivity widgets (in most cases) means adding visual elements to your original content: in other words, you're adding visual components that might distract the user from focusing on the content of the information.

To sum up, a good rule to live by is that you shouldn't add a feature for the sake of adding a feature. 

> Less is more.

## Web Accessibility 

### About Accessibility

When building professional Shiny applications, you have to keep in mind that, potentially, this app will be consume by a large audience. 
A large audience means that there's a chance that your app will be used by people with visual, mobility, or maybe cognitive disabilities^[
And of course, other type of disabilities.
]. 
Web Accessibility deals with the process of making the web available to people with disabilities. 

> The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

`r right_link("Accessibility in Context - The Web Accessibility Initiative", "https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/")`

When learning to code a web app through "canonical" courses, you'll be introduced to web Accessibility very early.
For example, you can learn about this straight from the first chapter of [learn.freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/). 
The first course, "Responsive Web Design Certification", has a chapter on web accessibility just after the one on HTML and CSS. 

### Making your App Accessible

#### Hierarchy

Headers are not just there to make your application stylish. 
`<h1>` to `<h6>` are there so they can create a hierarchy inside your webpage: `<h1>` being more important (hierarchically speaking) than `<h2>`.
In a perfectly designed website, you'd only have one header of level 1, a small amount of level 2 headers, more header of level 3, etc. 

Hence, you shouldn't rely on the header level for styling: don't use an `<h1>` because you need a larger title somewhere in your app. 
If you want to increase the size of an header, use CSS, which we will see in an upcoming chapter.

#### HTML element: Semantic tags, and tags metadata

In HTML, there are two kind of elements: the one without "meanings" like `<div>` or `<span>`, and the one which are considered meaningful, like `<title>` or `<article>`. 
The second ones are called "semantic tags", as they have a specific meaning in the sens that they define what they contain. 

```{r ux-matters-1-bis, results="asis"}
library(htmltools)
tags$article(
  tags$h2("Title"),
  tags$div("Content")
)
```

One other HTML method you can use is tags attributes as metadata. 
Tags attributes are complementary elements you can add to a tag to add information: most of the time, you'll be using it to add a CSS class, and identifier, or maybe some events like `onclick`^[
See the JavaScript chapter.
].
But these can also be used to add, for example, an alternate text to an image: this `alt` being the one which is read when the image is not available, either because the page couldn't reach the resource, or because the person navigating the app is using a screen to speech technology. 

```{r ux-matters-2-bis, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
ui <- function(request){
  tagList(
    plotOutput("plot") %>% 
      tagAppendAttributes(alt = "Plot of iris")
  )
}

server <- function(
  input, 
  output, 
  session
){
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    plot(iris)
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

What makes these two things similar (semantic tags and tags metadata) is that they are both unseen by user without any impairment: if the image is correctly rendered and the user is capable of reading images, chances are that this user will see the image. 
But these elements are made for people with disabilities, and especially users who might be using screen to speech technologies: these visitors use a software that scans the textual content of the page and reads it, and that helps navigate through the page. 

This navigation is also crucial when it comes to screen to speech technology: these softwares will be able to read the `<title>` tag, jump to the `<nav>`, or straight to the `<article>` on the page. 
Hence the importance of structuring the page: these technologies need the app to be built in a structured way, so that it's possible to jump from one section to another, and other common tasks a fully capable user will commonly do.

Some other tags exists and can be used for semantic purpose: for example `<address>`, `<video>`, or `<label>`.

#### Navigation 

Your app user might also have mobility impairment. 
For example, some with Parkinson might be using your app, or someone with a handicap making it harder for them to move their hand and click. 
For these users, moving an arm to grab the mouse might be challenging, and they might be navigating the web using their keyboard only. 

When building your app, thinking about how these users will be able to use it is crucial: maybe there are so may button they need to __click__ that they won't be able to use it. 
So, as much as possible, make everything doable with a keyboard: for example, if you have a `textInput()` with a validation button below, allow the user to validate by pressing the ENTER on their keyboard.

```{r ux-matters-3-bis, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
ui <- function(request){
  tagList(
    textInput("text", "title") %>% 
      tagAppendAttributes(
        onKeyPress = "Shiny.setInputValue('keypress', {value : event.key}, {priority: 'event'})"
      ), 
    actionButton("go", "Go")
  )
}

server <- function(
  input, 
  output, 
  session
){
  observeEvent( input$keypress , {
    
    if (input$keypress$value == "Enter"){
      # ...
    }
    
  })
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Note that if you need a more systemic way to do this, you can do it with the `{nter}` package:

```{r ux-matters-4-bis, eval=FALSE}
# Taken from https://github.com/JohnCoene/nter
library(nter)
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("text", ""),
  actionButton("send", "Don't click hit enter"),
  verbatimTextOutput("typed"),
  nter("send", "text") # trigger 'send' button when 'text' is active.
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  txt <- eventReactive(input$send, {
    input$text
  })

  output$typed <- renderPrint(txt())
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

#### Color choices

Color blindness is also a common impairment when it comes to web accessibility.
And it's a rather common deficiency: according to [colourblindawareness.org](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/), _"color (color) blindness (color vision deficiency, or CVD) affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women in the world"_.

Keeping in mind this prevalence of color blindness is even more important in the context of Shiny, where we are developing data science products, which most of the time include data visualization. 
If designed wrong, dataviz can be unreadable for some specific type of color blindness. 
That's why we recommend using the `viridis` palette, which has been created to be readable by the most common types of color blindness. 

Here are for example a visualization through the lens of various type of color blindness: 

```{r ux-matters-5}
# Function to generate the graph
with_palette <- function(palette) {
  x <- y <- seq(-8 * pi, 8 * pi, len = 40)
  r <- sqrt(outer(x^2, y^2, "+"))
  filled.contour(cos(r^2) * exp(-r / (2 * pi)),
    axes = FALSE,
    color.palette = palette,
    asp = 1
  )
}

```

With the `jet.colors` palette from `{matlab}`

```{r ux-matters-6}
with_palette(matlab::jet.colors)
```

```{r ux-matters-7}
with_palette(viridis::viridis)
```

Even without color-blindness, it's already way more readable.
But let's now use the `{dichromat}` package to simulate color blindness.

```{r ux-matters-8}
library(dichromat)
library(purrr)
```

+ Deutan with `jet.colors` and `viridis`

```{r ux-matters-9}
graph <- partial(dichromat, type = "deutan")
with_palette(
  compose( graph, matlab::jet.colors )
)
with_palette(
  compose( graph, viridis::viridis )
)
```


+ Protan with `jet.colors` and `viridis`

```{r ux-matters-10}
graph <- partial(dichromat, type = "protan")
with_palette(
  compose( graph, matlab::jet.colors )
)
with_palette(
  compose( graph, viridis::viridis )
)
```

+ Tritan with `jet.colors` and `viridis`

```{r ux-matters-11}
graph <- partial(dichromat, type = "tritan")
with_palette(
  compose( graph, matlab::jet.colors )
)
with_palette(
  compose( graph, viridis::viridis )
)
```

```{r ux-matters-12}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
with_palette(
  compose(
    partial(dichromat, type = "deutan"),
    matlab::jet.colors
    )
)
with_palette(
  compose(
    partial(dichromat, type = "deutan"),
    viridis::viridis
    )
)
```

As you can see, the viridis palette always gives a more readable graph than the `jet.colors` one. 
And, the plus side, it looks fantastic. 
So don't hesitate to try and use it!
