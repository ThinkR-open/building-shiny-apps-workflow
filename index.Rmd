This book is currently under development.
It will be published in 2020 in the [R Series](https://www.crcpress.com/go/the-r-series) by Chapman & Hall.

## Motivation {-}

This book will not __get you started with Shiny__, nor __talk about how to deploy into production and scale your app__. 
What we'll see is __the process of building the app__. 
Why? Lots of blog posts and books talk about starting to use `{shiny}` [@R-shiny] or putting apps in production.
Very few (if any) talk about this grey area between getting started and pushing into production. 

So this is what this book is going to talk about: building Shiny application. 
We'll focus on the process, the workflow, and the tools we use at ThinkR when building big Shiny Apps.

Hence, if you are starting to read this book, we assume you have a working knowledge of how to build a small application, and want to know how to go one step further. 

## Book structure {-}

+ Part 1 (Building big Shiny Apps) gives a general context about what a successful Shiny App is and what challenges arise when you are dealing with a large scale application. 
It also introduces the `{golem}` [@R-golem] package and more general concept about organising your workflow. 
This first part will be light on code: you will read more about conceptual ideas and organisation strategy. 

+ Parts 2 to 6 describe a series of steps you can take when you want to build a Shiny App, and the tooling associated with each step.

+ Part 7 (Optimizing) tackles the question of optimization, first by presenting some common caveats of Shiny Apps, and then showing how to optimize R code, and use JavaScript to lighten R work.

## About the authors {-}

<li><a href="https://colinfay.me/">Colin Fay</a></li>

Colin FAY works at ThinkR, a french agency focused on everything R-related. 

During the day, he helps companies to take full advantage of the power of R, by providing training (from beginner to expert), tools (packages, web apps...) and infrastructure. His main areas of expertise are data & software engineering, web applications (frontend and backend), and R in production. 

During the night, Colin is also an hyperactive open source developer and an open data advocate. You can find a lot of his work on his GitHub account (https://github.com/ColinFay) and on ThinkR's account (https://github.com/thinkr-open).

He is also active in the Data Science community in France, especially in his home town Rennes, where he founded the data-blogging website Data-Bzh.fr, co-founded the Breizh Data Club association, and organises the Breizh Data Club Meetups.  

<li><a href="https://statnmap.com/">Sébastien Rochette</a></li>

Sébastien is a data scientist at ThinkR, where he teaches anything R related from beginner to expert level, guides R developers towards implementation of best practices, and creates tailor-made R solutions for the needs of his customers.

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/VincentGuyader">Vincent Guyader</a></li>

ThinkR Founder, with more than 10 years of experience, and with a scientific and technical background, Vincent is an R-enthusiast. He still has his hands in the code, whether to develop applications, analyze data or build packages. When he’s not coding, he plays with Docker
and manages servers. He strongly believes that meeting highly technical challenges is not incompatible with pedagogy: he
passionately trains very diverse learner profiles at R.

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/CervanGirard">Cervan Girard</a></li>

Cervan is Data Scientist at ThinkR. 
He is enthusiastic and motivated when it comes to rolling up his sleeves for new challenges. Even if it means venturing dangerously into the depths of R, learning new languages and experimenting outside your comfort zone.
Nevertheless, he remains reliable, constructive and efficient when it comes to using his skills to train or develop. He also enjoys training learners of all levels in the R language.

## Disclaimer {-}

Open source is moving (very) fast, and some of the tools described in this book are  still under active development. 
But good news! 
A large portion of this book is about the methodology, and not purely the technology, so even if some of the packages and code described in this book become obsolete, a significant part of what is described in this book will still be relevant. 

When reading this book, remember that they are a "snapshot" of various technologies and packages, which might some day become out of date, have breaking changes, or even disappear.
We will try to update the online version whenever changes are made to the codebase of the packages used in this book, so feel free to browse the online version. 

The current version of this book has been compiled on:

```{r index-2 }
Sys.Date()
```

With the following configuration:

<details>
    <summary>See Session Information</summary>
```{r index-3 }
xfun::session_info()
```
</details>

## Software information and conventions {-}

This book has been built with `{knitr}` [@R-knitr] and `{bookdown}` [@R-bookdown]. 

Package names are in curly brackets in code format (e.g., `{rmarkdown}`), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`).
Function names are formatted in a typewriter font and followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`).
