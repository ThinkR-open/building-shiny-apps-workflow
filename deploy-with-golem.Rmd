# Deploy with `{golem}` {#deploy-golem}


It is essential to visualize its application very regularly during the development phase, and if possible under the same conditions as the production phase.


## Local deployment

A shiny application built from golem is _by definition_ encapsulated in an R package. To install your application on a computer with R, you "just" need to install the package you built.
From Rstudio in the project corresponding to the golem you built, the instruction `remotes::install_local()` will install your package on your computer. This corresponds to clicking on Build > Install Restart in the IDE.
To install your package on another computer, in a more conventional way you will need to create a bundled version of you package. To do this `devtools:build()` will generate a .tar.gz file like `mygolem_0.0.1.tar.gz`
